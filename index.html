<h4>Research Interests</h4>
<p>I am a first-year PhD student in Computer Science at Georgia Institute of Technology. 
	My current research interest is procedural text understanding. That is, enabling virtual assistants 
	to understand detailed instructions so that they can assist us humans in 
	carrying out specific tasks according to a specific set of instructions 
	(e.g. cooking instructions, wet lab protocols, sorting email)</p>
